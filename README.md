# DLSGAN

Official implement of DLSGAN  
  
Environment: Windows 10, Tensorflow 2.6  
  
To train model: edit HyperParameters.py, and run Main.py  
  
There are trained model with current hyperparameters setting in 'models' folder. To generate samples from trained model: set train_data_size=0, load_model=True evaluate_model=False in HyperParameters.py, and run Main.py  
  


Algorithm for DLSGAN is in "Train.py"
